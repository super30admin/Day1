# Approch:- Used 2 lists one to store stack elements and other to store current min_element.
# At all time both of these stacks contain same number of elements.
# Each Min stack is appended by minimum of (current min and new value)

# Time Complexity : O(1)
# Space Complexity :O(n) #For MinStack
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this :No
