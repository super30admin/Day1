# Design-1

## Problem 1:(https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/)
The myHashSet class represents a basic implementation of a hash set using a boolean array. Each element in the set is represented by a boolean value (true or false) in the array. The add method sets the corresponding index to true, remove sets it to false, and contains checks if the index is true or false. The class utilizes a fixed-size boolean array initialized with false values to represent the set.


## Problem 2:
Design MinStack (https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)

The minStack class uses two stacks to efficiently track the minimum element. Pushing compares the current minimum and updates it, and popping removes both the element and the minimum.
 time complexity of O(1) 
 space complexity of O(N)
