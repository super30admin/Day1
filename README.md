Explain your approach in **three sentences only** at top of your code

# Design-1

## Problem 1:(https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/)

this is like an array of integers. if a number is added that position value is kept true. if a value is removed it if made false. by seeing the Boolean value returned we can say if the set has the value asked or not.
add, remove, and search results in O(1).

## Problem 2:
Design MinStack (https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)
I used the hint given to design this. keeping minimum at each node/position along with the value(like keeping a array of 2 elements, one values is the original and the second is the minimum value till then)

push, pop, getmin, top results in O(1). but to save the minimum extra space is taken.
