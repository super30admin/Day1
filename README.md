# Design-1

## Problem 1:(https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/)
## Created hash set for a large number of elements.
## The hash function used is modulus so that we get an unique value each time the hash function executes.
## Get the index and the element to add / remove and return as per the function type.

## Problem 2:
## Design MinStack (https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)
## Define the minimum element as infinity and create an empty stack to return result.
## Compare the minimum element value with the input value and push the element to the stack, update the minimum value to compare
## Pop the top element out and compare the minimum element if it matches remove it.
## Return the top element and minimum value using standard functions.
