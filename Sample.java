// Question 1 : Design HashSet
// Time Complexity : for all functions O(1)
// Space Complexity : O(1)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No


// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach

// I have made a list and bucket size to 10000 as most call is 10000
// now I have creates a hash key function to generate the key at which I will append my unique values. 


// Design Min stack
// Time Complexity : O(1) 
// Space Complexity : O(2* 1) = O(2)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : Nope


// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
// I have implemented two list(Stack) and appended all the values in stack 1 and only min values in stack2
// while pop I compared the top values if equals then pop both else only pop the stack 1
// this way I havent used any loop thats why my time complexity is O(1)
